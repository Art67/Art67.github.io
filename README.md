Founders & Coders prerequisite.

EVERYDAY SCIENTIST:
First one-page website created for the Founders & Coders application.
I have left my comments in the code (talking to oneself is great).

Please note that while all external links (should!) work, the 'more...' link in the first column (from left) and the menu links won't take you to other pages, as the prerequisites specify a one-page website (and I didn't have time to research and write a proper article to complete the 'more...' bit).

Thanks for taking a look.
