Founders & Coders prerequisite.

EVERYDAY SCIENTIST:
-- First one-page website created for the Founders & Coders application (I used Notepad++). The website will (hopefully) tell you something about some of my interests and concerns. There's also a link to my LinkedIn profile, in case something like a CV might be useful to you.

-- The code most likely has inelegant workarounds; still, when I last tested it, it worked as expected on Firefox, Chrome, Opera, MS Explorer, MS Edge.

-- I have left my comments in the code (talking to oneself is great).

--Please note that while all external links (should!) work, the 'more...' link in the first column (from left) and the menu links won't take you to other pages, as the prerequisites specify a one-page website. Also, because the same prerequisites specify that we shouldn't use libraries etc., the search button doesn't launch an actual search (I made a Google Custom Search for the original version of the same website, on which the Github version is based).

Thanks for taking a look.
