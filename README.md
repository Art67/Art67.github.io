Founders & Coders prerequisite.

EVERYDAY SCIENTIST:
-- One-page website created for the Founders & Coders application (I used Notepad++). 

-- I chose to interpret the request to tell you 'something interesting' about myself figuratively, so I've created a one-page website that serves a 'practical' purpose (as I'll mostly have to do as a developer in real life), but still tells you something about some of my interests as well as concerns. I've included a link to my LinkedIn profile and to my photography blog, both of which will tell you more, and more directly, about my background and personal aesthetic, in case you'd like some additional information.

-- The code most likely has inelegant (I'm putting kindly) workarounds; still, when I last tested it, it worked as expected on Firefox, Chrome, Opera, MS Explorer, MS Edge and, as a friend verified, on Safari. The next (small) challenge I've set myself is to create a demo website that is designed to be disability-friendly.

-- I have left my comments in the code (talking to oneself is great, after all).

-- Please note that while all external links (should!) work, the 'more...' link in the first column (from left) and the menu links won't take you to other pages, as the prerequisites specify a one-page website. Also, because the same prerequisites specify that we shouldn't use libraries etc., the search button doesn't launch an actual search (I made a Google Custom Search for the draft of the same website, on which the Github version is based).

Thank you for taking a look.
